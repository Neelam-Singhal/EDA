# EDA

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Why do we need EDA?

1. Help draw out Insights from data.
    - Variable Identification (int, char or mix) (id variable type)
    - Behaviour of variables (value is between 1-10 or 1-1000000)
    - Relationship b/w variables

2. Consistency of data:
    - All data present?
    - Missing values
    - Outliers

3. Feature Engineering

All these 3 are bedrock for predictive modelling

### Steps in EDA:
1. Variable identification
2. Univariate Analysis
3. Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
4. Missing values treatment
5. Outliers removal

### What are we exploring:
1. What are the different variables
2. Any missing values
3. What is distribution on variables‚Äù?
4. Are there any extreme values
5. Is there any evident treand/patttern
6. What are the transformations required
7. Which variables are highly correlated?
